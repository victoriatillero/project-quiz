# project-quiz
### A new developer's quiz game

### Planning
1. what I've done so far is create all the files needed for my project and put in the boilerplate on my HTML docu.

2. The first thing I did after getting the project approved is work on my HTML so I could begin to visually see the elements I'd be working with

3. I then worked on my CSS to get a better idea of how I wanted the quiz to look.

4. From my CSS, I began to work on the JavaScript to make the game functional.

5. I did make sure my code was working without errors when I deployed it. I feel I may have done something erroneously while making this README.md
