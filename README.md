### About the game:
I created a quiz game to help new developers get more comforable with JavaScript and Emmet Abbreviations. The quiz will not provide the correct answer if it is guessed incorrectly to encourage playing again and learning the material. Once the round is complete, the user can either play the same category again or a different category. If a user scores less than 3 correct, they will hear a message that says "better luck next time." If the user get a perfect score, confetti will be triggered to celebrate the win.

### Instructions:
1. **Select category**: For now, it's either javaScript or Emmet, but will later include more languages.

2. **Select answer**: Once the user has read the question and is ready to select an answer, user clicks the appropriate button. The button  either turns red or green, depending on correctness of answer.

3. **Next button**: Once the user has looked over the question and result, user must click the next question button to move onto next question. User is able to use the next button to skip a question, but it will be counted against them.

4. **Play again**: Once the quiz is done, the user will see the results and can decide whether he'd like to play again either in the same category or a different one.

### Technologies used:
* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript

## Planned Future Enhancements

* Add more categories (Python,Ruby, specific parts of JS like objects, arrays,, etc. )

* Implement a leaderboard, which includes the name and the time it took the user to complete the quiz. This will allow a user to keep track of their score over time. The leaderboard should get cleared everytime there is an update to the category, so that if new questions are added, the user can quickly identify that they haven't completed that version yet.

* Randomization of questions, to ensure user does not just remember the order in which questions were asked and get a correct score that way
